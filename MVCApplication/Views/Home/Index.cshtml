    <p>Professor Stuesse has had a long and successful career in the arts, having received many commissions over the years in cities from Chicago to Bangkok, but always returns to &ldquo;the job I call a dream.&rdquo; For his dedication to teaching and community involvement, the Roux Academy is proud to award him with this year&rsquo;s prize, which also includes a stipend for pursuit of personal projects outside the academy. Congratulations, Professor Stuesse!</p>
